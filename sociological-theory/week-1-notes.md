### **Big Picture**

Sociology is unusual among social sciences because:

1. **Theory-heavy**: Linking ideas to foundational works is central.
2. **Methodologically diverse**: Multiple ways of doing research coexist.
3. **Historically oriented**: “Classics” matter a lot, more than in fields like Economics or Psychology.

Sociology keeps revisiting its foundational thinkers (Durkheim, Weber, Marx, Du Bois, etc.) and debates about who belongs in the canon.

### **Classical Theory**

* Usually refers to sociology from **mid-19th century to early 20th century**.
* Responded to huge social changes: industrialization, urbanization, democracy, colonialism.
* Key thinkers:

  * Auguste Comte (coined “sociology”)
  * Spencer, Durkheim, Marx, Weber, Simmel
  * Chicago School: Mead, symbolic interactionism
  * Du Bois and Atlanta School (historically marginalized)
* Classical theory is about **scientifically understanding society**, even if methods differed.

---

### **Problems with Classical Theory**

1. **What counts as “classical”?**

   * Chronological: \~1860s–1920s.
   * Criticism: Sociology may overemphasize historical figures rather than ideas themselves.
2. **What should we learn from it?**

   * Classical texts still offer insights, but theory shouldn’t be separated from method.
   * Modern sociology is richer when connecting classics to current research questions.
3. **Alternatives to current teaching**

   * Avoid focusing only on “great men” or biographies.
   * Focus instead on **core themes and ideas** that inspire research, not just historical texts.
   * Treat classics as conceptual guides, not untouchable authority.

### **Handbook’s Approach**

* Not a biographical review of theorists.
* Focuses on **themes, dynamics, and concepts** from classical theory.
* Encourages **forward-looking interpretation**, linking classical ideas to contemporary sociology.
* Organizes content into six themes:

  1. **Overarching Concerns** – foundational questions and methods
  2. **Central Dynamics** – key processes like differentiation and power
  3. **Spheres of Social Life** – domains like family, religion, politics, economy
  4. **New Social Forms**
  5. **Interactions, Symbols, and Psyche**
  6. **Conceptual Threads** – connecting ideas across themes

---

### **Why it matters**

* Sociology is held together not by allegiance to old thinkers but by **central ideas about social life**.
* Revisiting classical theory is valuable **if it sparks research and critical thinking**, not just memorization.
* The Handbook aims to **modernize the teaching of classical theory**, making it more relevant today.
