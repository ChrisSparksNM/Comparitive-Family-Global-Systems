Here’s a **concise bullet-point summary** of everything we’ve discussed so far about Marx:

---

### Marx and Hegel

* Marx critiqued **Hegel’s *Philosophy of Right***, which idealized the state as the embodiment of freedom.
* Hegel’s stages:

  1. **Abstract right** – legal rights, property, contracts.
  2. **Morality** – individual conscience and responsibility.
  3. **Ethical life (Sittlichkeit)** – family, civil society, and the state as the culmination of freedom.
* Marx argued Hegel was “upside down”: real social relations (material life, labor, and class) produce the state, not abstract ideas.

### Political Economy

* Political economy = early economics, studying production, distribution, and consumption of wealth, tied to politics and society.
* Marx studied classical political economists (Smith, Ricardo) **critically and empirically**, exposing capitalism’s exploitative structures.
* Empirical analysis = observing real-world evidence (factory reports, wages, historical data) instead of just theorizing.

### Labor, Wages, and Capital

* **Workers are treated as commodities**: their lives depend on market demand for labor, controlled by capitalists.
* **Market fluctuations**:

  * Wages are more vulnerable than profits; rent is least affected.
  * Workers suffer first during economic downturns.
* **Inverse relationship between wages and prices**: when provisions get expensive, wages rise, but in cheap years wages can fall; some workers still go hungry.
* Wages vary widely due to natural, mental, and social differences in labor; capital yields more uniform profits because it’s “dead” and impersonal.
* **Capital accumulation = worker exploitation**: wealth grows by taking surplus labor from workers; workers’ labor becomes property of capitalists.

### Publications and Context

* *Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher* = radical journal Marx co-edited in 1844; published early critiques of Hegel and political economy.
* Marx distinguished between **philosophical speculation (Hegel)** and **empirical, evidence-based analysis** (political economy).
