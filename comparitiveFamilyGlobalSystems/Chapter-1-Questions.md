# What is world systems theory? Dependency theory? Modernization theory?
Here are clear explanations of each theory:

---

### **1. World-Systems Theory**

* Developed by **Immanuel Wallerstein**.
* Explains global inequality as a result of the **global capitalist system**, which divides nations into:

  * **Core countries** – wealthy, industrialized, and dominant (e.g., U.S., Western Europe).
  * **Semi-periphery countries** – intermediate, some industry but still dependent (e.g., Brazil, India).
  * **Periphery countries** – poor, dependent on core for trade, raw materials, and technology (e.g., many African nations).
* **Key Idea:** Economic and political relationships keep poor countries dependent and rich countries powerful.

---

### **2. Dependency Theory**

* Originated in Latin America (1950s–60s).
* Argues that **underdeveloped nations are poor because they have been exploited by developed nations**, especially through colonialism and neocolonialism.
* Wealth flows from the **periphery (poor)** to the **core (rich)**, keeping poor nations dependent on exports of raw materials and imports of manufactured goods.
* **Solution suggested:** Reduce dependency by building self-sufficient economies.

---

### **3. Modernization Theory**

* Popular in the 1950s–60s.
* Argues that **all societies progress through similar stages of development**, from traditional to modern.
* Believes poor nations are underdeveloped because they lack:

  * Technology
  * Education
  * Modern values (such as individualism, efficiency)
* **Solution suggested:** Adopt modern institutions, technology, and cultural values from developed nations.
* **Criticism:** Seen as ethnocentric (favoring Western models) and ignoring global inequality caused by exploitation.

#  Why does the United States have poor areas? Use the concept of internal colonialism.
The concept of **internal colonialism** explains poor areas in the United States as a result of **systematic economic and political domination of minority groups within the same country**, similar to how colonial powers exploited colonies.

### **Internal Colonialism and Poverty in the U.S.**

* **Definition:** Internal colonialism occurs when a dominant group exploits minority groups within the nation's borders, controlling their land, labor, and resources while limiting their economic and social opportunities.
* **Application to U.S.:**

  * **Native American reservations** – Land and resources taken, forced relocation, economic dependence on federal aid.
  * **African American communities** – Historical slavery followed by segregation, discrimination in housing and employment, creating concentrated poverty.
  * **Latino and immigrant labor** – Low wages and limited mobility in agricultural and service industries.
* **How it creates poor areas:**

  * Systematic **underinvestment in minority communities** (schools, infrastructure).
  * **Restricted access to wealth and property** (redlining, discriminatory lending).
  * **Labor exploitation** (low-paying jobs with little advancement).

**Result:** Certain racial and ethnic groups remain economically disadvantaged, creating **persistent pockets of poverty** in cities and rural areas.

# What is the diﬀerence between ethnocentrism and cultural relativity?
Here’s the difference explained clearly:

---

### **Ethnocentrism**

* **Definition:** The tendency to **judge other cultures by the standards and values of your own culture**, often viewing your culture as superior.
* **Example:** Thinking that eating with chopsticks is “weird” because you’re used to forks and knives.

---

### **Cultural Relativism**

* **Definition:** The idea that **a culture should be understood and evaluated based on its own values and norms, not by the standards of another culture**.
* **Example:** Understanding that eating with chopsticks is normal in East Asian cultures and not judging it as strange.

---

✅ **Key Difference:**

* **Ethnocentrism = Judgmental (my culture is the standard).**
* **Cultural Relativism = Understanding (every culture has its own logic).**

# What are the core, the periphery, and the semi-periphery? Who developed this language and the theory?
This terminology comes from World-Systems Theory, developed by Immanuel Wallerstein in the 1970s.

Core

Description: Wealthy, industrialized nations that dominate global trade, technology, and finance.

Characteristics: High wages, advanced technology, strong governments, and global influence.

Examples: United States, Germany, Japan.

Periphery

Description: Poor, less-developed nations that provide raw materials, agricultural products, and cheap labor to core countries.

Characteristics: Weak economies, low wages, political instability, dependency on core countries.

Examples: Many African countries, parts of South Asia.

Semi-Periphery

Description: Nations that fall between core and periphery, acting as a buffer. They have some industry and economic stability but still rely on core nations.

Characteristics: Moderate technology, emerging economies, often exploit periphery while being exploited by core.

Examples: Brazil, India, Mexico.

# Where did apartheid exist and why?
**Apartheid** existed in **South Africa** (1948–1994) as a system of **institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination** enforced by the white minority government.

---

### **Where?**

* South Africa (and South West Africa, now Namibia, under South African control).

---

### **Why did apartheid exist?**

* **Economic Reasons:**

  * To ensure cheap labor for white-owned farms, mines, and industries.
  * To keep wealth and land in the hands of the white minority.
* **Political Reasons:**

  * To maintain white minority rule despite being a demographic minority.
  * Prevent black South Africans from gaining political power.
* **Ideological Reasons:**

  * Based on racist beliefs that whites were superior and should dominate.
  * Influenced by colonial thinking and segregationist policies.

---

It legally divided people into racial categories (**white, black, colored, Indian**) and controlled where they could live, work, and travel.

---

# What is abject, or absolute, poverty?
**Abject poverty**, also called **absolute poverty**, refers to a condition where a person lacks the basic necessities required for survival, such as:

* **Food**
* **Clean water**
* **Shelter**
* **Clothing**
* **Healthcare**

It means living **below a minimum standard of living**, regardless of the society’s overall wealth. The World Bank defines extreme (absolute) poverty as living on **less than \$2.15 per day (as of 2022)**.

**Example:** People living in famine-stricken regions with no access to clean water or adequate food.

---
# What is a postcolonial analysis of how to approach the family?
A **postcolonial analysis of how to approach the family** examines how **colonial histories, power relations, and cultural impositions** have shaped family structures, roles, and dynamics in formerly colonized societies. It focuses on challenging Eurocentric assumptions and acknowledging diverse cultural practices.

---

### **Key Points in a Postcolonial Approach**

1. **Critique of Western Norms**

   * Traditional Western models (nuclear family, gender roles) were often imposed during colonial rule.
   * Postcolonial analysis rejects the idea that these are the “ideal” or universal family structures.

2. **Recognition of Historical Power**

   * Colonial authorities disrupted indigenous family systems (e.g., through boarding schools, missionary influence, legal systems).
   * Families in postcolonial contexts may still experience the effects of these disruptions.

3. **Valuing Indigenous Knowledge and Practices**

   * Instead of imposing Western norms, the approach encourages understanding local family systems on their own terms.
   * Promotes cultural relativism and respect for traditional kinship systems.

4. **Intersection with Social Issues**

   * Examines how race, gender, and class inequalities (rooted in colonial histories) affect families today.
   * Addresses issues like migration, labor exploitation, and displacement as legacies of colonialism.

---

✅ **In short:** A postcolonial analysis calls for **decolonizing family studies**, understanding families in their **historical and cultural contexts**, and **resisting ethnocentrism**.
